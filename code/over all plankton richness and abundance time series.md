Description: This project explores temporal patterns in zooplankton and phytoplankton
  communities across multiple coastal sites. The focus is on tracking changes
  in plankton richness (number of taxa) and abundance (total counts) over time,
  and comparing these patterns between regions. By visualising and analysing
  date-by-date time series, the project aims to identify seasonal peaks and lows,
  evaluate spatial differences between sites, and provide a foundation for
  further comparisons with water quality variables such as nutrients, turbidity,
  temperature, and sali
